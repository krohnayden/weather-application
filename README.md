# Weather-Application

## Description

The weather application provides the weather for any city as well as a five day forecast. My motivation for this project was to provide a user with an application that shows the weather. I learned about innerHTML and backticks, which were essential in completing this project.

## Installation

To install this project, click on the URL provided and enter the city of your choice. You will then be presented with the current weather for that city, and a five day forecast. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To use, enter the city of your choice, then you can view the weather for that city.
